# USED CASES
<< 1ST OF ALL I HAVE EXPERIENCED IN [ HTML, CSS, PYTHON, JAVASCRIPT, NODE.JS, EXPRESS.JS, MONGODB, REACT, AWS (S3, EC2...), REDIS, GITHUB, CI/CD PIPELINE, DOCKER ]
<< SO THE THING IS LANGUAGE AND FRAMEWORK AS WELL AS DATABSES ARE LIKE A PIECE OF CAKE FOR EVERY DEVELOPER 
<< IT MEANS IF WE CAN DO A THING THEN WE CAN LEARN OR ACHIEVE MANY THINGS LIKE THAT AND I AM ALSO PASSIONATE FOR LEARN NEW TECHNOLOGIES

    1. In this assignment i have used <Node.js> as language instead of <Java>
    2. I have used <Express.js> instead of <springboot> .. Basically Express is a very popular framework of Node.js which is used 
       for devlop the backend of a web application
    3. I have used <MongoDB> as the database instead of RDBMS like (mySql, postgreSql)
    4. I have optimized the api calls .
    5. All of the codes are written in proper fashion to increase readbility ..  
    6. Here I have use axios for 3rd party server calling
    7. If again someone try to get the weather dtails by used pincode and date , at that it 1st check the database , then if the data is not present in   
       that database then it will automatically call to a [Ref: https://openweathermap.org/current] for weather details and store it on MongoDB
    8. Here for getting the historical weather details of a specific date of a pincode we have to use one call 3.0 on openweathermap api 
       [Ref: https://openweathermap.org/current] which is a separate subscription for paid user....

# THE ASSIGNMENT
Backend Assignment - Weather Info
for Pincode

< You need to provide a single REST API for weather information for a particular day and a

    Pincode
    Input
    pincode: 411014
    for_date: 2020-10-15
    Weather information for Pincode
    Save this information in DB(RDBMS)
    1. Please save pincode lat, long separately
    2. Also the weather information for the particular pincode
    3. Next time we call the API then based on the information saved, API calls should optimized
# Ref: https://openweathermap.org/current

< Optimized for API calls

    ● Pincode to lat long(Google Maps, Openweather Geocoding API)
    ● Lat long to Weather information (OpenWeather API)

< Things to take care of

    1. Only REST API - No UI
    2. Testable by Postman/Swagger - No UI
    3. Will prefer code structured in proper fashion
    4. Will prefer Testcases (TDD)
